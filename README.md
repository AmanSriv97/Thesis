Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.
It is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. Brain cell connections and the cells themselves degenerate and die, eventually destroying memory and other important mental functions. Memory loss and confusion are the main symptoms.
No cure exists, but medication and management strategies may temporarily improve symptoms.

This code is a Machine Learning and Deep learning implementation in the field of Single Cell technology. This python based code takes single cell 10x genomics data and selects out features using mRMR feature selection and then various ML and DL methods are used to find out suitable markers for biomarker selection.

The model trains with an accuracy of 99% and delverys a validation accuracy on the dataset with 98% accuracy.
